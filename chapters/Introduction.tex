\section{Create-IT}
Create-IT applied research is one of the research institutes hosted by the University of Applied Sciences of Amsterdam. In this lab students, teachers and researchers all preform applied studies in the different sections of the IT world. Their goal is to educate future professionals in the uses of applied research, so these professionals can anticipate the ever changing field that is Information Technology.
In the newly created Game Research Lab students and researchers alike contribute to the growing community of game developers; making the development of games easier or trying to understand current problems within the industry\footnote{How much can a few lines suck?}.

\section{Technology}
This section covers the technologies used by me in developing and demonstrating the \diage system.

And this thesis has been created in LaTeX.
\section{Rough planning estimate}
This project lasts for 20 weeks, and the following will indicate my initial planning.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Week 1-6} Literary study
	\item \textbf{Week 7-13} Creating a generative algorithm
	\item \textbf{Week 14-20} Proof of concept. 
\end{itemize}
