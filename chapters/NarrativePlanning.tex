\chapter{Narrative planning}
\textit{This chapter will discuss the use of a narrative planner as used by many of my sources. I want to incorporate a narrative planner that smartly uses \diage to manipulate a narrative and conveys that in a way we petty humans can understand}

A lot of related work as gone into the use of a planning system that decides on the narrative structure. Researchers like Riedl~\cite{Riedl03character-focusednarrative}\cite{Riedl:2003:MIU:860575.860694}\cite{Riedl:2004:IPM:1018409.1018753} and Cavazza~\cite{Cavazza:2002:CIS:630325.630747} have been researching the use of artificial intelligence for years, and have made some interesting planning systems like \textit{Memesis}~\citationneeded. I am developing my own planning system to use \diage as input and output and use \textit{Ludoscope} to manipulate the diagram as a graph (see section~\ref{sec:ludoscope} for more on Ludoscope) for the model transformations.
